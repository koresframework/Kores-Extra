/**
 * Defines the alias of the method. This alias is the name of the method in the annotations to unify. This allows
 * more conventional names for interface methods rather than naming conventions used in annotations, so instead
 * of naming a method in this way: `age`, you can name it as `getAge` and add [Alias] annotation with `age` value.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Annotation:
 * ```
 * annotation class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
 * ```
 *
 * Unification interface:
 *
 * ```
 * interface UnifiedPerson {
 *     @Alias("name")
 *     fun getName(): String
 *     @Alias("age")
 *     fun getAge(): Int
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * We can also use Kotlin properties, but alias still required because Kotlin properties are compiled to getters methods
 * (and setters if property is mutable, but this is irrelevant for unification).
